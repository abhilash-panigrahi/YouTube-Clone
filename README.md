# YouTube-Clone
This project involves creating a static clone of the YouTube homepage using HTML and CSS only. The goal is to replicate the visual structure, layout, and responsiveness of YouTube’s user interface. The clone focuses on understanding semantic HTML, modern CSS layouts, and responsive design principles.
